# arguments:
'''
The results set has the song titles from crawled playlists and song titles from the context
- make a gpt prompt based on the diagram that has fewshot prompting
- in the task description, pass in the context 
- return the sentence (str), specific songs used and their ids (as JSON?)

- in the main file the return list has the context already in it so make these separate things that are passed in

- input is context (str) and results (set of tuples where tuple[0] is song title and tuple[1] is id)
